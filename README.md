Quick Note:

Throughout the code there is some redundancy and over complexity, which might be fixed, but it
serves a purpose. It serves as an oppourtunity to experiment with new concepts.
Particularly, the exception handling code could easily be simplified.
Replacing the class hierarchy inside the Exceptions.h with simple wrapper functors is perhaps the most
profound example. Such simple functors would merely need to encapsulate common exception throwing code.
The purpose of over engineering the exception handling code was to learn basic uses of templates
and polymorphism. In the future - this might be patched, but it is unlikely as this project merely
served as a learning experience.
